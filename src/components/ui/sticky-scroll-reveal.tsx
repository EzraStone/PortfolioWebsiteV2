I served as a mentor for four new members to the club, [Carlos Catala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cataladev/), [Daniel Efres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-efres/), [Carlos Lopez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carloselopezjr/) (who we call Carfos to deal with the duplicate names) and [Sam Borges](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-xavier-borges/), pictured left to right. \\n\\n Now at this time in my career, I was not where I am today. I had no super crazy industry experiences, or big accolades to boast. But I felt I had something to teach this group, and that was **passion**. Beyond just the handful of technical skills I taught them from our workshops, I instilled in them a passion for software, learning, and the **Knight Hacks** community. And it paid off. Each of them are off interning, researching, building awesome projects, and now running **Knight Hacks** right along side me - and I couldn't be more proud."

Up to this point, I'd have attended every single **Knight Hacks** event but a few, and my determination was clear. \\n\\n About 4 months later, I was re-elected as the **President** of Knight Hacks after a board vacancy opened, making me the youngest President in the club's history. In our first year, our board was able to completely re-imagine the limits of the organization and ran an amazing Hackathon for **550+** hackers from all throughout Florida. In only one year, I'd have gone from **hacker** to **organizer**. It was the **passion** for the club and the culture that kept me going."

                                Based on my personal experiences, community is
                                one of the most important things for my success.
                                The collective wisdom and effort of my
                                community, both professionally and technically,
                                has been invaluable in my journey. Thus, I

                                To me, the most important metric of success is
                                consistent and continuous progress. I take
                                advantage of every opportunity to learn and
                                grow, either technically, professionally, or
                                personally. I also aim to help inspire others to
                                work towards their own progress, which I have
                                cultivated through my work with the{" "}

                                I am a firm believer in the importance of
                                starting small and building up to bigger goals.
                                As engineers, we often get caught up in our
                                current capabilities, feeling Imposter Syndrome
                                or doubt when we are just starting out. However,
                                I believe the best way to overcome this feeling
                                of doubt is by simply doing. Drop the tutorials
                                and docs, and just start building. Fail fast,
                                learn even faster.
